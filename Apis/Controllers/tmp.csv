Lyrics::

আব্বু একবার কয় কেন পড়তে বসিস না 
 Papa asks, why don't you mind your studies?

 আম্মু একবার কয় কেন লিখতে বসিস না 
Mummy demands, why don't you get down to writing?

কি করে বলি আমি পড়ালেখা ভালো লাগে না .
How can I explain,I don't enjoy studies


///ঘুম না হতেই ডাকাডাকি সকাল বেলা
I'm pulled out of bed before I had my quota of sleep

শুধু বই নিয়ে পড়তে বলে কি ঝামেলা 
What a hassle to concentrate on the books?

ঘুম যে চোখে মানে না 
When eyes droop with drowsiness 

আম্মু তাহা বোঝেনা 
Mummy doesn't realise that

চোখ রাঙিয়ে বলে আমায় দেরি করিস না.
Bawl out on me not to waste time.


///আমি যদি বলি একটু করব খেলা আম্মু 
If I plead, mummy, let me play for a while

বলে খেলবি কেন দুপুর বেলা
She rebukes me for wanting to play at noon

আমি যদি হতাম মা
If I were a mother

বাধা নিষেধ করতাম না
I wouldn't have forbidden my daughter

আমার মেয়ে বলতো আমায়
My daughter would have said to me,

কত ভালো মা
How lovely my mother is!.


///হঠাৎ যদি পৃথিবীটা এমন হতো 
If the world had changed all on a sudden

মাস্টারের লেখাপড়া ভুলে যেতে 
If the teachers had unlearned education

হতো যদি ঘূর্ণিঝড় 
If a tornado had struck

উড়ে যেত স্কুল ঘর 
Blowing away school buildings

জুম্মাবারের শিরনী দিতাম মনের বাসনা
I would have sacrificed my wishes at the mosque on Fridays.

Lyrics :
keejo kesaree ke laal mera chhota sa yah kaam
meree raam jee kah dena jay siyaaraam x 2

main raam sang japata tumhaara sada naam
apane raam jee se kah dena jay siya raam

keejo kesaree ke laal mera chhota sa yah kaam
meree raam jee kah dena jay siyaaraam

Deen heen ke sahaare mahaaveer tum ho
apane bhakto kee jagaate takadeer tum ho
apane bhakto kee jagaate takadeer tum ho

har dukhiya ka haath tum lete ho thaam
mere raam jee se kah dena jay siyaaraam
meree raam jee kah dena jay siyaaraam

main raam sang japata tumhaara sada naam
apane raam jee se kah dena jay siya raam

Jai Shree Ram...

mahaabalee mahaayodha mahaasant tum ho
laate sookhe hue baago mein basant tum ho
laate sookhe hue baago mein basant tum ho
teree bhakti se aatma ko milata aaraam

keejo kesaree ke laal mera chhota sa yah kaam

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2GMCnJUq8,Petrol Pump Scam⛽️ #finance #petrol #education,"🔸So you ask for petrol for ₹ 500, the attendant asks you to check the meter at ZERO and then stats filling the petrol and stops at ₹ 100. When you ask him why he stopped at ₹ 100, he tells you that he heard ₹ 100 only. Then he says that no issues, he will reset and fill another ₹ 400 (will give some crap technical reason why he can’t continue from that same point).

At this point someone from his team distracts you while the attendant starts filling from ₹ 100 onwards itself, when you think that he had reset the meter back to ZERO. Then he goes till ₹ 400 and charges you ₹ 500 (₹ 100 + ₹ 400). You get petrol worth ₹ 400 only, but pay ₹ 500.

🔸In these tricks, someone distracts you in the name of PUC, cleaning of vehicle, or will just ask you some silly thing and you turn your eyes away from meter.

➡️To report fraud, customers can call the legal metrology officer in-charge whose name and number have to be displayed at petrol pumps.

Even in twenty first century, menstrual period remains a taboo in Indian society. Many school going girls fail to realise that periods are a natural part of their growth and something not to be ashamed of. The boys equally need education about their female co-students' physiological development and be more receptive about it. 
In an attempt to raise awareness in school going children about the menstrual period, 'Imdaad' ,which translates into 'Helper', has been made.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f28uJL7hfRs,"Sex Education, season 3 First Kiss - Otis and Ruby (Asa Butterfield)","🙏  Please LIKE And SUBSCRIBE.

Sex Education, season 3, Netflix: Laurie Nunn's sex-positive sitcom finally returns to Netflix, with returning performances from Asa Butterfield, Gillian Anderson, Emma Mackey and Ncuti Gatwa. Jason Isaac also stars

Sex Education 3x01, CAST:
Asa Butterfield as Otis Milburn
Mimi Keene as Ruby Matthews

When watching the first episode, this critic revelled in the return to writer/creator Laurie Nunn's fantastical town – sliding back into the throng of Moordale's citizens, who are either sexually liberated or stressfully repressed. And what better way to kick off a new season than with another (mostly) orgasmic montage, featuring the core characters (too many to name) having a lot of glorious sex in their own, unique ways.

Even Otis (Asa Butterfield) gets his end away. It shows his libidinal arc: starting with little sexual motivation in season one, copiously masturbating in season two, then having regular sex in season three. And with the most popular girl in school, too: the brilliantly savage Ruby Matthews (Mimi Keene).

In season three, the writers gather even more confidence in their style and characters – relaxing into them. They're less concerned with an overarching plot and focus on the thematic connections, which flow beautifully together in a multi-coloured confluence.

Eric (Ncuti Gatwa) and his former bully Adam (Connor Swindells) are now a couple, and the latter struggles to leave his aggressive masculinity behind. This offers Swindells a wider emotional range for his performance, to the point where seeing him happy feels like a rare and heartwarming sight. Adam’s father, the former headteacher Michael Groff (Alistair Petrie), moves in with his hyper-masculine older brother Peter (Jason Isaacs) after being fired and separating from his wife Maureen (Samantha Spiro).

A new non-binary character, Cal (Dua Saleh), enters the frame and their gender identity is constantly challenged. Eric explores his roots, the series making a brave move to Nigeria. Otis camouflages himself into Ruby’s world to fit in and, as a result of the Maeve heartbreak last term, tries not to care about anything any more (‘things are easier when you don’t care – no one gets hurt’). And the lovably ditsy Aimee (Aimee Lou Wood) still wrestles with the trauma from her sexual assault in season two.

This term also sees the entrance of a new headteacher, Hope Haddon (Jemima Kirke). She saunters into Moordale Secondary School like a cool and colourful teacher, but it’s obviously a front. Before long, the school resembles a totalitarian state: students are given uniforms, lockers are painted grey, and dividing lines are painted on the floor. More crucially: free thought from the students, anything that smells of change or liberal politics, is strangled to facilitate a metallic, Orwellian vision.

The regime change brings the students, all similar in their differences, together. They unite in their sex positivity and take pride in their identities. The series teaches, above everything else, to be harmlessly proud of who you are. To fight to be heard. The test in season three is maintaining that confidence in oneself, no matter the fragile, conservative powers that try to suppress it. Sex Education says it loud. A riotous, hilarious, and educational delight from start to finish.

Sex Education, season 3 is available on Netflix from Friday 17 September

An unorthodox sex clinic, in which Moordale High students Otis (Asa Butterfield) and Maeve (Emma Mackey) gave their peers relationship advice provided the backbone for the glorious coming-of-age stories in Sex Education. The clinic was a vehicle through which Otis could share his wisdom (gleaned from his mother, an actual sex therapist played by Gillian Anderson) and students could confess their secret fears. In the third season, the clinic is no more – and the story suffers as a result.

Things fell apart for good reason at the end of season two. Otis and Maeve’s will-they-won’t-they friendship collapsed – and the school board took issue with Moordale’s burgeoning reputation as “the sex school”. Season three sees creator Laurie Nunn expand the show’s focus beyond Otis and Maeve, giving more time to Otis’ best friend Eric (Ncuti Gatwa) and his new relationship with former school bully Adam (Connor Swindells). Meanwhile, Otis’ mum Jean (Gillian Anderson) must come to terms with her new pregnancy by a partner who doesn’t completely trust her.

We also meet new non-binary student Cal (Dua Saleh, a revelation) who strikes up a friendship with head boy Jackson (Kedar Williams-Stirling); and the tyrannical incoming headmistress Hope (Jemima Kirke). Aimee (Aimee Lou Wood) is still trying to process her sexual assault, and Lily (Tanya Reynolds) is questioning her devotion to aliens. In short? It’s a lot.",Kino book,"Sex Education season 3,Sex Education season 3 kiss,Sex Education 3 kiss,Sex Education kiss,Sex Education kiss scene,Sex Education season 3 Otis,Sex Education Otis,Sex Education Otis kiss,Sex Education Otis and Ruby kiss,Sex Education Otis and Ruby,Otis and Ruby,Otis and Ruby kiss,Asa Butterfield kiss,kiss",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program",2021-09-17T10:17:25Z,PT32S,30570631,308,true,false,[object Object]

Secondly, predators will probably increase in number, it will be difficult for fishes to hide, there will be complete chaos everywhere.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVvAkPbJwnw,"Dark Reality of Indian Education System | Dhruv Rathee","Aamir Khan's 3 idiots was a superhit movie back then in 2009. We all loved it, but it seems that the message is still not implemented. Because even today in 2022, the pressure on students to pursue stereotypical degrees like engineering, doctor, etc. is real. A kid has to convince his parents to allow him to do something like becoming a YouTuber, Graphic Designer, Video Editor, etc. But why the situation is like this? Why do we have such strong stereotypes? Watch this video by Dhruv Rathee as he explains the root cause of this unfortunate problem that continues to exist in our society for decades - the education system.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVvAkPbJwnw,"Dark Reality of Indian Education System | Dhruv Rathee","Aamir Khan's 3 idiots was a superhit movie back then in 2009. We all loved it, but it seems that the message is still not implemented. Because even today in 2022, the pressure on students to pursue stereotypical degrees like engineering, doctor, etc. is real. A kid has to convince his parents to allow him to do something like becoming a YouTuber, Graphic Designer, Video Editor, etc. But why the situation is like this? Why do we have such strong stereotypes? Watch this video by Dhruv Rathee as he explains the root cause of this unfortunate problem that continues to exist in our society for decades - the education system.

What if Elevators Disappeared?
Firstly, if elevators disappeared, escalators will suddenly become extremely popular, people may start installing them in their homes.
Secondly, if elevators disappeared, high-rise buildings may lose their popularity, people may start vacating offices located on top floors.
Thirdly, if elevators disappeared, single storey homes will start selling like hot cakes.
Fourthly, if elevators disappeared, getting to the top of Eiffel tower may remain just a dream for many.
Fifthly, if elevators disappeared, hospitals will be the most impacted, all the patients will have to be shifted to the ground floor.
Lastly, if elevators disappeared, creative people may figure out innovative ways of solving the problem.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkM1sB4c_4,Save Money with Education Loan #loan #banks #finance #education,"➡️Repayment Holiday
🔸 A moratorium period aka Loan Repayment Holiday in education loan is defined as the time where the borrower is not required to repay the loan.

Usually, in personal loans, repayment for a loan starts soon after a borrower takes it, but in the education loan moratorium period, lenders allow students to start their repayment once they finish their course and start earning.

The moratorium period is usually the course duration plus 6 months or 1 year where the lender allows a student to take adequate time to sort out their finances and prepare for loan repayment accordingly.

- Banks generally charge interest for the moratorium period, which is later added to the principal. As the interest on the loan generally accrues over the moratorium period, a lender usually calculates interest on the loan on a simple interest basis. So, students who are willing to start their monthly EMIs (equated monthly installment) can start paying during the moratorium period as this would ultimately help them relieve the interest burden.

➡️Section 80E:
🔸 The interest amount paid during the financial year is allowable as a deduction from taxable* income. There is no limit on the deduction amount. The benefit of the deduction is available for a maximum of 8 years or till the interest is paid, whichever is earlier. It is applicable even when you have taken the education loan for your spouse, children or for a student for whom you are the legal guardian.

➡️So if someone tries to convince you to take up somer other kind of loan like, “loan against your property” or “gold loan” to finance you education then please avoid it cause you’ll loose major benefits which is exclusive to education loan.

🟡 This live stream displays a trading chart. It's a standard chart, but unlike other platforms, it's modified to show the current market developments in a simple form and easy to understand.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

🛠️ HOW TO CORRECTLY UNDERSTAND SUPPLY AND DEMAND ZONES :

1, Identify supply and demand zones:
Green rectangles represent supply zone.
Orange rectangles represent demand zone.

2, Enter a potential trade in demand or supply zones:
When the price enters an orange zone (demand), check if your indicator generates a BUY SIGNAL, which could be a potential signal to buy.

When the price enters a green zone (supply), check if your indicator generates a SELL SIGNAL, which could be a potential signal to sell.

3, Enter only with confirmation from supply and demand zones:
Before entering a trade, confirm that the BUY SIGNAL or SELL SIGNAL aligns with the current supply or demand zone. The signal is stronger when it is closer to the zone, and it's recommended to use signals that are directly within the zones. This provides a more robust confirmation of the potential trade setup.

4, Risk management. 
Determine the amount of risk for each trade and adhere to risk management principles. ALWAYS Set a stop-loss to minimize losses.

5, Experiment on a demo account:
Learn and  Experiment with it on a demo accounts do not use real money to better understand its behavior.

6, Watch for potential divergences:
Monitor situations where the price enters a supply or demand zone, but the indicator does not provide a corresponding signal. This may indicate a potential divergence and requires caution.

7, Monitor macroeconomic events:
Stay informed about macroeconomic events that could impact the market, as such events may influence the effectiveness of the indicator.

🚩SIGNAL CONFIRMATION RULE: Market conditions change every second. 
It is crucial to wait for the signal candle to close to confirm the validity of the signal. 
Patience is key, as the signal may disappear if not confirmed by the closing of the candle. Sucess rate here is between 72-81%  on last 1000 trades, many times Signals are not correct or late, use them with demo or paper accounts only !

GUIDE ON HOW TO UNDERSTAND SIGNALS and ZONES in our LIVE STREAMS is here:

Recommended video: Interesting facts about reptiles 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B0apT6VZKk&t=29s

Hello friends! Welcome to a new Happy Learning video. 
Today, we’re going to meet animals that have eight legs, and are a little scary! Today, we’re going to meet.. arachnids! 

Same as insects, arachnids are invertebrates and belong to the arthropods. But don’t get confused! Arachnids are part of a different animal group than insects, while insects have six legs, arachnids have eight! Like you can see in these images. 

Spiders, scorpions and dust mites are part of the arachnid family, and share a number of characteristics that we need to know. 

They have four pairs of articulated legs, they don’t have antennae or wings, but they do have a pair of clamps by their mouth called chelicerae (kelicera) that they use to hold their prey. 
A fun fact about arachnids is that they can’t chew, so they swallow their prey by sucking them in. They suck the soft parts as if with a straw. They are carnivores, and spiders and scorpions feed from insects, other arachnids and sometimes small reptiles and mammals. 

An Arachnid’s body is divided in two parts: cephalothorax, consisting of their head, and thorax, joined in a single segment, and the abdomen, that can be segmented, or not. 

Arachnids breathe through traqueas or pulmonary sacs. 
And when they’re born, they look the same as they do when they are adults, but of course, they are much smaller. 

Scorpions are the biggest arachnids, the largest ones can measure up to 20cm. 
They have huge chelicerae (kelicera) in their heads they use them to grab their prey, before they inject venom with their sting at the end of their tail. 

Spiders are the most popular arachnids, but also the scariest. Most of them are venomous, but very few are truly dangerous for human beings. The truth is spiders are astonishing animals. 
Also! Apart from being able to produce their famous spider web, they are able to hunt their prey in multiple ways, look look!

Dust mites are the least popular arachnids, because they are so small you can’t see them at a glance, they are microscopic, but what is true is that they’re everywhere!
In every house there are thousands and thousands of dust mites… 

Well, now we know a little more about arachnids, the truth is they are very strange and mysterious animals. But, as for everything else, they are important for balance of life, of this marvellous life.

Nightmares are disturbing dreams that generate feelings of fear and anxiety, abruptly awakening us. On waking, we feel our heart pounding and can usually recollect the nightmare. Nightmares usually occur during the REM stage of sleep. Even though they are more common in children, many adults also experience them.

There could be multiple reasons behind nightmares. Having late-night snacks increases our metabolism, triggering more brainwaves and causing nightmares. Certain medications like blood pressure medications, antidepressants, etc. can also cause nightmares. Also, if we are sleep deprived or have certain sleep disorders, this can also lead to nightmares. Stress and anxiety can also lead to adult nightmares. People who have experienced a huge trauma or are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder can also suffer from nightmares. Thus, eating healthy, sleeping on a schedule and staying stress-free can help us stay away from nightmares.",It's AumSum Time,"aum,aumsum,aum sum,it's aumsum time,smart learning for all,animation,student,school,education,science,Secondary School (School Category),Biology,Nightmare,Nightmares,Why do we get Nightmares,REM,REM sleep,sleep,sleeping",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge,2019-07-03T01:30:00Z,PT4M16S,4872851,0,true,true,[object Object]

Have you ever wondered why the top 10% of people control 85% of global wealth? It's because many of us are caught in an education trap without even realising it

There is something you have never been told about the education system. We got stuck in a system today that keeps us from getting rich, making money, and living a good life.

That's what I'm going to talk about in this video: the dark truth about how our education system came into existence and how we got trapped.
